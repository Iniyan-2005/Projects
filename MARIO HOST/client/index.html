                <h3>🍄 My Origins — 1981</h3>
                Back in the day, I was just a humble carpenter named Jumpman, running around dodging barrels to rescue Pauline from a big, angry ape named Donkey Kong. That was my first time in the arcades. People didn’t know me yet... but they would.
                <h3>🔨 1983 – Meet My Bro!</h3>
                Then came Mario Bros, where I switched careers — from carpenter to plumber. Why? Because the game was set in the sewers of Brooklyn! I teamed up with my younger brother, Luigi, and together we started squashing turtles and cleaning pipes. Family business, you know?
                <h3>🌈1985 – Super Time!</h3>
                Boom!I hit the big time with Super Mario Bros on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). It was me, the Mushroom Kingdom, Princess Peach, Goombas, Koopas, and of course — that fire-breathing turtle tyrant, Bowser. It was side-scrolling magic, and it changed video games forever.
                <h3> ✨The Power-Ups!</h3>
                🍄 Super Mushroom – Made me grow big!
                🌟 Star – Invincible Mario, baby!
                🔥 Fire Flower – Pew-pew fireball Mario!
                Each one added a new twist to my adventures.
                <h3>🌎Worlds & Galaxies</h3>
                I didn't stop there! I went 3D in Super Mario 64, surfed through space in Super Mario Galaxy, and even became a cat in Super Mario 3D World. I've driven go-karts, played tennis, golf, soccer, and even had epic Smash Bros. battles!
                <h3> 👨‍👦Family & Friends</h3>
                you know Luigi. But there’s also:
                Yoshi – my dino buddy 🦖
                Toad – the loyal mushroom pal 🍄
                Princess Peach – always getting kidnapped... but always staying strong 👑
                Wario & Waluigi – ugh… the weird cousins 😅
                <h3>🧢 2017 – I Got a Hat With Eyes!</h3>
                Super Mario Odyssey took me around the globe — and my hat Cappylet me possess Goombas, tanks, and even a dinosaur! Yeah. I’ve really leveled up.
                <h3>🧱 Today...</h3>
                I’m still jumping, still saving the day, and still shouting "Let’s-a go!"
                Whether it’s the Switch, mobile phones, LEGO sets, or the Super Mario Movie, I’m still around — making people smile, one 1-Up at a time.
                So yeah... that’s my journey from a pixel plumber to a global icon.
                Wanna go on an adventure with me next? 🍄🚀
